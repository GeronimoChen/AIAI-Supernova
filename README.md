# AIAI-Supernova

It is the code repository for "Artificial Intelligence Assisted Inversion (AIAI) of Synthetic Type Ia Supernovae" (arxiv:1911.05209).  

Because of the data limit in github, I upload the full spectral flux and element abundance data onto kaggle, the website is https://www.kaggle.com/geronimoestellarchen/aiaisupernova . 

## Environment Requirements

-keras
-tensorflow
-dust_extinction


## The Code Structure

Most of the codes are in jupyter notebook. 

## To-Do Lists

I have not formalized the code for the 3000-5200 Angstrom wavelength spectra, and the code for absolute luminosity predictions. 
Also, I didn't upload the template comparison code to estimate the galactic extinction effect yet. 
Maybe, I can launch a kaggle competition for it? 
Because I am not so sure my neural network structure is the finest-tuned, any weird network structures are welcomed.
