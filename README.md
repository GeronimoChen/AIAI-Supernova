# AIAI-Supernova

It is the code repository for "Artificial Intelligence Assisted Inversion (AIAI) of Synthetic Type Ia Supernovae" (arxiv:1911.05209).  

Because the data limit, I upload the full spectral flux and element abundance data onto kaggle, the website is https://www.kaggle.com/geronimoestellarchen/aiaisupernova . 

## The Code Structure

## To-Do Lists

I have not formalized the code for the 3000-5200 Angstrom wavelength spectra, and the code for absolute luminosity predictions. 
Also, I didn't upload the template comparison code to estimate the galactic extinction effect yet.
